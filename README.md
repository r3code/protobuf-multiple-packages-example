# protobuf-multiple-packages-example
This repository is to show how to orginize protobuf files into multiple packages and compile them.

Here I have two examples with descriptions. Take a look at folders `example1` and `example2`.
The first one describes the most common case.
The second one describes how to use a bit longer pakage name to clarify message types in the code (e.g. adding `companyname`).
